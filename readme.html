The code associated with the educational book:

Cohen MX (2017) MATLAB for Brain and Cognitive Scientists :1-576

is freely available at Mike X Cohen's web site (after you follow the
below link, scroll down until you see the MATLAB for Brain and
Cognitive Scientists title) which also contains links to where the
book may be purchased at amazon.com or MIT Press:

The code (see below for why it generates several errors) is
specifically at this link:

"Using the code without following the book may lead to confusion,
incorrect data analyses, and misinterpretations of results.

Note that the code is meant to accompany the book, and is thus best
understood by going through the code while reading the book.
Mike X Cohen assumes no responsibility for inappropriate or incorrect
use of this code. "

Running the chapter23.m code, for example, produces the following
image:

<img src="./screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" width="550">

and then generates an error message (on purpose) which is an exercise
for the student to fix!

After the code is fixed, eight more figures are generated, for
example:

<img src="./fig6.png" alt="fig 6" width="550">
